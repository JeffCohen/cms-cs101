# Algorithmic Complexity

In which we decipher the confusing O(n), O(log n), O(n2) notation....

Also called computational complexity

Characterizes the worst-case performance of an algorithm with respect to input size

Math shapes: cubic, quadratic, logarthimic, linear, flat


O(n)

O(log n)

O(n log n)

O(n^2)


How can we determine complexity of an algorithm we write?

Watch out for nested loops
