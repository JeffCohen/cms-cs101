# Welcome to Computer Science for Normal People

## Fundamentals of Algorithm Design

* Why do I sometimes read things about linked lists, binary trees, acyclic directed graphs, and other crazy data structures?
* What is recursion, and how would I know when I have a problem that needs a recursive solution?
* Level up your coding skills by learning how to write fundamental searching and sorting algorithms.
* What is "big O" notation all about?

## Computer Science: The Good Parts

* What are "monte carlo" simulations and how is it used to plan wifi networks, affect city planning, and perform wildlife simulations?
* What's the difference between top-down and bottom-up design?
* What is "Russian-doll" caching?
* What is a "turing-complete" solution and why should I care?
* How do I get started in the field of artificial intelligence?
